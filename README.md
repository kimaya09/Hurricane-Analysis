## HURRICANE ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

# This is a dashboard that gives you visual data about the lat and long of the hurricane as well as the win speed, storm speed and other information.

![This is a preview of the dashboard, but it is available as a twbx file to download and interact with. All of the visuals are dynamic and interact according to the filters applied](/Users/kimayak/Downloads/HurricaneDashboardImage.png)
